A template for a cv based on the [CV](https://github.com/adamaltmejd/cv) of Adam Altmejd. 

The original code is distributed under the MIT license and the content of the CV is property of Adam Altmejd.

Icons from [Fontawesome 5](https://fontawesome.com) (CC 4.0).

Adapted for TeXmacs by M. Gubinelli.

An example [PDF output](./cv-altmejd.pdf) and the obligatory screenshot ![screenshot](./screenshot.png).

HTML output is also supported ![screenshot](./screenshot-html.png) 

## Remarks

The style file `cv-altmejd.ts` contains all it is necessary to produce a new CV (including the raster icons). 

For HTML output the custom CSS file `cv-altmejd-texmacs.css` is required.

An old preliminary implementation (with macros in the prologue) is provided in `cv-altmejd-old.tm` for pedagogical purposes.
